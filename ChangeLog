We don't have a single ChangeLog. Instead use the following resources:

1. Development

  OWFS development is managed by CVS, and the definitive source for code
modifications is the CVS log entries.

  http://owfs.cvs.sourceforge.net/owfs/

2. Releases

  Each release has brief release notes included on the download page of the
Sourceforge site.

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/owfs/files/

3. Discussion

  Discussion of changes and direction of program development occurs on the
owfs-developer's mailing list.

4. Documentation
