This is owfs, part of OWFS project -- 1-Wire Filesystem for Linux.
This modlue provieds the frontend for the owlib and fuse library,
implementing a user-space filesystem, with appropriate ties
into system calls.

Basically, fuse (http://avf.sourceforge.net) exposes filesysstem calls
in the appropriate directory to this program. This program then
calls owlib to query and modify the 1-wire bus.

See OWFS (http://owfs.sourceforge.net).

Fully functional, though development is ongoing.

Your contribution is welcome.

You will need to get, build and install the 'owlib' module from the same
location you've obtained this module in order to be able to build this
module. As an alternative, you may try to get the RPM modules (owfs-libs and
owfs) from SourceForge download site, here:
