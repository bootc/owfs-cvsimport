This is a skeleton for owfs, part of OWFS project
(http://owfs.sourceforge.net).

At this time, it is not completely functional (it is assumed that you've
obtained this code from the CVS repository). If you have any questions, ask
them to owfs-developers mailing list.

Your contribution is welcome.

You will need to get, build and install the 'owlib' module from the same
location you've obtained this module in order to be able to build this
module. As an alternative, you may try to get the RPM modules (owfs-libs and
owfs) from SourceForge download site, here:
