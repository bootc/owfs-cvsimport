.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS fasttemp
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Low resolution but faster temperature reading by the chip. (~9 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs (3)
or
.B owhttp (3)
for choises. Default is Celsius.
Conversion takes 94 msec.
.SS power
.I read-only,yes-no
.br
Is the chip powered externally (1) or from the parasitically from the data bus (0)?
.SS temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
.I Temperature
read by the chip at high resolution (~12 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs (3)
or
.B owhttp (3)
for choises. Default is Celsius.
Conversion takes 750 msec.
.SS temphigh templow
.I read-write. floating point
.br
Temperature limits for alarms. Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs (3)
or
.B owhttp (3)
for choises. Default is Celsius.
.br
Note that alarms are not implemented.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.SS address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceeding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS present
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
.SH ALARMS
None implemented.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a 1-wire bus device. The 1-wire bus is a simple networking system created by Dallas Semiconductor that allows low-cost low-power communication over a single wire (plus ground). Power is often delivered "parasitically" from the same data line. Each device has a unique unalterable ID and can be individually addressed.
.PP
The
.B DS1822
is one a several available 1-wire temperature sensors. Alternatives are the
.B DS18S20,
.B DS18B20
as well as temperature/voltage measurements in the
.B DS2436
and
.B DS2438.
For truly versatile temperature measurements, see the protean
.B DS1921 Thermachron.
.br
Although the
.B DS1822
can select between 4 resolutions, this program simplifies the interface by only implementing the fastest/roughest and slowest/best.
.SH ADDRESSING
All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:
.TP
.B Family Code
8 bits
.TP
.B Address
48 bits
.TP
.B CRC
8 bits
.IP
.PP
Addressing under OWFS is in hexidecimal, of form:
.IP
.B 01.123456789ABC
.PP
where
.B 01
is an example 8-bit family code, and
.B 12345678ABC
is an example 48 bit address.
.PP
The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
