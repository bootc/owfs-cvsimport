.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS fasttemp
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Low resolution but faster temperature reading by the chip. (~9 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
Conversion takes 94 msec.
.SS die
.I read-only,ascii
.br
Two character manufacturing die lot. "B6" "B7" or "C2"
.SS power
.I read-only,yes-no
.br
Is the chip powered externally (=1) or from the parasitically from the data bus (=0)?
.SS temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
.I Temperature
read by the chip at high resolution (~12 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
Conversion takes 750 msec.
.SS temphigh templow
.I read-write. floating point
.br
Temperature limits for alarms. Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
.br
Note that alarms are not implemented.
.SS trim
.I read-write,unsigned integer
.br
32 bit trim value in the EEPROM of the chip. When written, it does not seem to read back. Used for a production problem in the B7
.I die.
See AN247.pdf
.br
Read allowed for all chips. Only B7 chips can written.
.SS trimblanket
.I read-write,yes-no
.br
Writing non-zero (=1) puts a default trim value in the chip. Only applied to the B7
.I die.
Reading will be true (non-zero) if trim value is the blanket value. Again, only B7 chips will register true, and since the written trim values cannot be read, this value may have little utility.
.SS trimvalid
.I read-only,yes-no
.br
Is the 
.I trim 
value in the valid range? Non-zero if true, which includes all non-B7 chips.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.so standard
.SH ALARMS
None implemented.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.so description
.SS DS1822
The
.B DS1822 (3)
is one of several available 1-wire temperature sensors. Alternatives are the
.B DS18S20 (3),
.B DS18B20 (3)
as well as temperature/voltage measurements in the
.B DS2436 (3)
and
.B DS2438 (3).
For truly versatile temperature measurements, see the protean
.B DS1921 (3) Thermachron (3).
.PP
Although the
.B DS1822 (3)
can select between 4 resolutions, this program simplifies the interface by only implementing the fastest/roughest and slowest/best.
