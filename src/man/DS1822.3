.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS fasttemp
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Low resolution but faster temperature reading by the chip. (~9 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
Conversion takes 94 msec.
.SS die
.I read-only,ascii
.br
Two character manufacturing die lot. "B6" "B7" or "C2"
.SS power
.I read-only,yes-no
.br
Is the chip powered externally (1) or from the parasitically from the data bus (0)?
.SS temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
.I Temperature
read by the chip at high resolution (~12 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
Conversion takes 750 msec.
.SS temphigh templow
.I read-write. floating point
.br
Temperature limits for alarms. Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
.br
Note that alarms are not implemented.
.SS trim
.I read-write,unsigned integer
.br
32 bit trim value in the EEPROM of the chip. When written, it does not seem to read back. Used for a production problem in the B7
.I die.
See AN247.pdf
.br
Read allowed for all chips. Only B7 chips can written.
.SS trimblanket
.I read-write,yes-no
.br
Writing non-zero (1) puts a default trim value in the chip. Only applied to the B7
.I die.
Reading will be true (non-zero) if trim value is the blanket value. Again, only B7 chips will register true, and since the written trim values cannot be read, this value may have little utility.
.SS trimvalid
.I read-only,yes-no
.br
Is the 
.I trim 
value in the valid range? Non-zero if true, which includes all non-B7 chips.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.SS address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceeding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS present
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
.SH ALARMS
None implemented.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.so description
.SS DS1822
The
.B DS1822 (3)
is one of several available 1-wire temperature sensors. Alternatives are the
.B DS18S20,
.B DS18B20
as well as temperature/voltage measurements in the
.B DS2436
and
.B DS2438.
For truly versatile temperature measurements, see the protean
.B DS1921 Thermachron.
.PP
Although the
.B DS1822
can select between 4 resolutions, this program simplifies the interface by only implementing the fastest/roughest and slowest/best.
