.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS power
.I read-only,yes-no
.br
Is the chip powered externally (=1) or from the parasitically from the data bus (=0)?
.SS prog_addr
.I read-only, 0-15
.br
A distiguishing feature of the
.B DS1825 (3)
is the ability to set hardware pins for an address (0-15). This is an alternative to the unique 64-bit
.I address
that is set in the factory.
.SS temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Measured temperature with 12 bit resolution. 
.SS temperature9 temperature10 temperature11 temperature12
.I read-only, floating point
Measured temperature at 9 to 12 bit resolution. There is a tradeoff of time versus accuracy in the temperature measurement.
.PP
The
.B MAX31826
measures all temperatures at 12 bit resoltion and will return that resolution to all the possible temperature properties.
.SS fasttemp
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Equivalent to
.I temperature9
.so temperature_threshold.3so
.PP
The 
.B MAX31826
does NOT have temperature thresholds and temperature alarm.
.SH MEMORY
Only the
.B MAX31826 
supports memory functions.
.SS pages/page.0 .. pages/page.15 pages/page.ALL
.I read/write, binary
.br
EEPROM memory pages of 8 bytes each. See the datasheet about locking contents.
.SS memory
.I read/write, binary
.br
EEPROM memory of 128 bytes. See the datasheet about locking contents.

.SH DESCRIPTION

.SS DS1825
The
.B DS1825 (3)
is one of several available 1-wire temperature sensors. Alternatives are the
.B DS18S20 (3),
.B DS18B20 (3),
and
.B DS1822 (3)
as well as temperature/voltage measurements in the
.B DS2436 (3)
and
.B DS2438 (3).
For truly versatile temperature measurements, see the protean
.B DS1921 (3) Thermachron (3).
.PP
The
.B DS1825 (3)
can select between 4 resolutionsspanning the fastest/roughest and slowest/best.
.SS MAX31826
The
.B MAX31826
shares a family code with the
.B DS1825
but has differences in some of its functions.
.PP
The 
.B MAX31826
has 128 btes of EEPROM memory (as 16 pages of 8 bytes) while the
.B DS1825
has no memory available.
.PP
The 
.B MAX31826
measures temperature at 12 bit resolution as fast as the 
.B DS1825's
lowest resolution (and always uses 12-bit resolution). On the other hand it has no temperature thresholds or alarm function.
.SH ADDRESSING
.so addressing.3so
.PP
Both the
.B MAX31826
and the 
.B DS1825
allow hardware selection of part of the address, which can assist selecting between chips is some circuit designs.
