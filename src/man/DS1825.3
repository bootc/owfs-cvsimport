.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS power
.I read-only,yes-no
.br
Is the chip powered externally (=1) or from the parasitically from the data bus (=0)?
.SS prog_addr
.I read-only, 0-15
.br
A distiguishing feature of the
.B DS1825 (3)
is the ability to set hardware pins for an address (0-15). This is an alternative to the unique 64-bit
.I address
that is set in the factory.
.SS temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Measured temperature with 12 bit resolution. 
.SS temperature9 temperature10 temperature11 temperature12
.I read-only, floating point
Measured temperature at 9 to 12 bit resolution. There is a tradeoff of time versus accuracy in the temperature measurement.
.SS fasttemp
.I read-only, floating point

.SH DESCRIPTION

.SS DS1825
The
.B DS1825 (3)
is one of several available 1-wire temperature sensors. Alternatives are the
.B DS18S20 (3),
.B DS18B20 (3),
and
.B DS1822 (3)
as well as temperature/voltage measurements in the
.B DS2436 (3)
and
.B DS2438 (3).
For truly versatile temperature measurements, see the protean
.B DS1921 (3) Thermachron (3).
.PP
Although the
.B DS1825 (3)
can select between 4 resolutions, this program simplifies the interface by only implementing the fastest/roughest and slowest/best.
