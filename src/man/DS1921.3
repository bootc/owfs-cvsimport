.SS about/measuring
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is this
.I DS1921
currently
.I measuring
a temperature?
.SS about/resolution
.I read-only, floating point
.br
What is the
.I resolution
of the temperature measurments (in the current temperature scale).
.SS about/samples
.I read-only, unsigned integer
.br
How many total temperature measurements has this
.I DS1921
performed?
.SS about/temphigh
.I read-only, floating point
.br

.I DS1921
can measure (in the current temperature scale).
.SS about/templow
.I read-only, floating point
.br

.I DS1921
can measure (in the current temperature scale).
.SS abount/version
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Specific
.I version
of this
.I DS1921.
.SS clock/date
.I read-write, ascii
.br
26 character date representation of the internal time stored in this
.I DS1921.
Increments once per second while
.I clock/running
.br
Setting
.I date
to a null string will put the current system time.
.br
Accepted date formats are:
.br
  Sat[urday] March 12 12:23:59 2001
.br
  Apr[il] 4 9:34:56 2002
.br
  3/23/04 23:34:57
.br
  current locale setting (your system's format)
.SS clock/running
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
Whether the internal clock is running. This can be explicitly set, and is automatically started by
setting
.I clock/date
or
.I clock/udate
or by starting a mission with
.I mission/easystart
or
.I mission/frequency
.PP
The main reason to stop the clock is to conserve the internal battery.
The clock cannot be stopped during a mission, and the clock is essential for a mission.
.SS clock/udate
.I read-write, unsigned integer
.br
A numeric representation of
.I clock/date
.br
The number of seconds in UNIX time (since Jan 1, 1970).
.SS histogram/counts.0 ... histogram/counts.62 histogram/counts.ALL
.I read-only, unsigned integer
.br
The number of samples in the current mission whose temperature fell within the
.I histogram/temperature
to
.I histogram/temperature+histogram/gap
range.
.SS histogram/elements
.I read-only, unsigned integer
.br
The number of bins in the histogram. Always 63.
.SS histogram/gap
.I read-only, floating point
.br
The size of the histogram bin. Depends on the Thermochron version (
.I about/version
) and is usually 4 times
.I about/resolution
.PP
Given in the current temperatature scale.
.SS histogram/temperature.0 ... histogram/temperature.62 histogram/temperature.ALL
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Lower limit of the temperature range for the corresponding histogram bin. In the current temperature scale.
.SS log/date.0 ... log/date.2047 log/date.ALL
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Date that the corresponding
.I log/temperature
was taken, in ascii format. (See
.I clock/date
for more on the format).
The number of valid entries is actually
.I log/elements
since the log may not be full.
.PP
.I mission/samples
gives the total number of samples that have been taken but there is only room in the log for 2048 entries.
Once the log is full,
.I mission/rollover
determines the Thermochron's behavior.
.PP
If
.I mission/rollover
is false(0), the log will hold the
.B first
2048 samples and
.I log/date.0
will always be the same as
.I mission/date
.PP
If
.I mission/rollover
is true (1) then the log will hold the
.B last
2048 samples and the entries will be shifted down with each new sample.
.PP
Note the
.I OWFS
code "untwists" the rollover behavior. The data will always be a linear array of earliest to latest.
.PP
.I ALL
is the all data elements comma separated.
.SS log/elements
.I read-only, unsigned integer
.br
Number of valid entries in the log.
.I OWFS
offers the full 2048 values in the log memory, but not that many samples may yet have been taken.
.I log/elements
will range from 0 to 2048 and always be less than or equal to
.I mission/samples
.SS log/temperature.0 ... log/temperature.2047 log/temperature.ALL
.I read-write, floating point
.br
The temperature readings (in the current temperature scale) that correspond to the
.I log/date
sample. See
.I log/date
for details on the indexing scheme and rollover behavior.
.SS log/udate.0 ... log/udate.2047 log/udate.ALL
.I read-write, unsigned integer
.br
A numeric representation of
.I log/date
.br
The number of seconds in UNIX time (since Jan 1, 1970).
.SS memory
.I read-write, binary
.br
User available storage space. 512 bytes. Can also be accessed as 16 pages of 32 bytes with the
.I pages/page.x
properties.
.SS overtemp/count.0 ... overtemp/count.11 overtemp/count.ALL
.SS undertemp/count.0 ... undertemp/count.11 undertemp/count.ALL
.I read-only, unsigned integer
.br

.I mission/frequency
minutes long.
.SS overtemp/end.0 ... overtemp/end.11 overtemp/end.ALL
.SS undertemp/end.0 ... undertemp/end.11 undertemp/end.ALL
.I read-only, ascii
.br
End of time that the Thermochron went out of range during the current mission. See
.I clock/date
for format.
.PP
Each period can be up to 255 samples in length, and span the time
.I overtemp/date
to
.I overtemp/end
( or
.I undertemp/date
to
.I undertemp/end
).
.SS overtemp/date.0 ... overtemp/date.11 overtemp/date.ALL
.SS undertemp/date.0 ... undertemp/date.11 undertemp/date.ALL
.I read-only, ascii

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a 1-wire bus device. The 1-wire bus is a simple networking system created by Dalla Semiconductor that allows low-cost low-power communication over a single wire (plus ground). Power is often delivered "parasitically" from the same data line. Each device has a unique unalterable ID and can be individually addressed.
.PP
The
.B DS1921
is an iButton device with many intriguing functions. Essentially it monitors temperature, giving both a log of readings, and a histogram of temperature ranges. The specification is somewhat complex, but OWFS hides many of the implementation details.
.PP
While on a
.I mission
the
.B DS1921
records temperature readings in a 2048-sample log and adds the to 62-bin histogram. more complete form of the
.B DS2438
battery chip. Current sensing is availble, but not implemented. The major advantage compared to the
.B DS2436
is that two voltages can be read, allowing correcting circuit nmeasurements to supply voltage and temperature.
.SH ADDRESSING
All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:
.TP
.B Family Code
8 bits
.TP
.B Address
48 bits
.TP
.B CRC
8 bits
.IP
.PP
Addressing under OWFS is in hexidecimal, of form:
.IP
.B 01.123456789ABC
.PP
where
.B 01
is an example 8-bit family code, and
.B 12345678ABC
is an example 48 bit address.
.PP
The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
