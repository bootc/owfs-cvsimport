.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS memory
.I read-write, binary
.br
32704 bytes of memory. Possibly protected by a password.
.SS pages/page.0 ... pages/page.510 pages/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 511 pages of 64 bytes each.
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially.
.SS set_number/full set_number/read
.I write-only, ascii
.br
Passwords entered as numbers, either decimal, or hex of form 0x0123456789ABCDEF. Handled the same as
.I set_password/xxx
.SS set_password/enable
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
Turn on/off password protection for the DS1977, or return the current state.
.SS set_password/full set_password/read
.I write-only, binary
.br
Passwords (8 byte values) that allow read or full access to the DS1977 memory. The password set by
.I set_password/xxx
are stored in the DS1977 and locally in the program as well (as if
.I use_password/xxx
was also called).
.SS use_password/full use_password/read
.I write-only, binary
.br
Passwords (8 byte values) that allow read or full access to the DS1977 memory. The password set by
.SS use_number/full use_number/read
.I write-only, ascii
.br
Passwords entered as numbers, either decimal, or hex of form 0x0123456789ABCDEF. Handled the same as
.I use_password/xxx
.SS use_password/full use_password/read
.I write-only, binary
.br
Passwords (8 byte values) that allow read or full access to the DS1977 memory. The password set by
.I use_password/xxx
are stored in the program and must match the passwords stored in the DS1977. Changing the DS1977 passwords using
.I set_password/xxx
will change these values as well.
.I use_password/xxx
are stored in the program and must match the passwords stored in the DS1977. Changing the DS1977 passwords using
.I set_password/xxx
will change these values as well.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.SS address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceeding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS present
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
.SH ALARMS
None.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a 1-wire bus device. The 1-wire bus is a simple networking system created by Dalla Semiconductor that allows low-cost low-power communication over a single wire (plus ground). Power is often delivered "parasitically" from the same data line. Each device has a unique unalterable ID and can be individually addressed.
.PP
The
.B DS1977
is an iButton with static memory that is optionally protected by a password.
.SH ADDRESSING
All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:
.TP
.B Family Code
8 bits
.TP
.B Address
48 bits
.TP
.B CRC
8 bits
.IP
.PP
Addressing under OWFS is in hexidecimal, of form:
.IP
.B 01.123456789ABC
.PP
where
.B 01
is an example 8-bit family code, and
.B 12345678ABC
is an example 48 bit address.
.PP
The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
