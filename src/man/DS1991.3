.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS memory
.I read-write, binary
.br
144 bytes of non-volatile memory. Reading and writing (with offset) to the files will only work if currently used password is correct for all 3 pages.
.SS pages/page.0 pages/page.1 pages/page.2 pages/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 3 pages of 48 bytes each.
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially. If currently used password is incorrect, random data will be returned when reading a page.
.SS pages/password.0 pages/password.1 pages/password.2 pages/password.ALL
.I write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 3 pages and each page has a unique password (8 bytes).
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the password. Each page is accessed sequentially. Writing to this file will set the currently used password when accessing memory in corresponding page. If the password is wrong, random data will be returned when reading memory.
.SS pages/ident.0 pages/ident.1 pages/ident.2 pages/ident.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 3 pages and each page has a unique identification (8 bytes).
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the ident. Each page is accessed sequentially. Identification will return correct result even if currently used password is incorrect.
.SS settings/page.0 settings/page.1 settings/page.2 settings/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 3 pages of 48 bytes each.
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially. If currently used password is incorrect, random data will be returned when reading a page. (same as pages/page.*)
.SS settings/ident.0 settings/ident.1 settings/ident.2 settings/ident.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 3 pages and each page has a unique identification (8 bytes).
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the ident. Each page is accessed sequentially. Identification will return correct result even if currently used password is incorrect. (same as pages/ident.*)
.SS settings/password.0 settings/password.1 settings/password.2 settings/password.ALL
.I write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 3 pages and each page has a unique password (8 bytes).
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the password. Each page is accessed sequentially. Writing to this file will set the currently used password when accessing memory in corresponding page. If the password is wrong, random data will be returned when reading memory. (same as pages/password.*)
.SS settings/reset_password.0 settings/reset_password.1 settings/reset_password.2 settings/reset_password.ALL
.I write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 3 pages and each page has a unique password (8 bytes).
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the ident. Each page is accessed sequentially. Writing to this file will reset the password on the page. NOTE: All data in corresponding page will be deleted!
.SS settings/change_password.0 settings/change_password.1 settings/change_password.2 settings/change_password.ALL
.I write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 3 pages and each page has a unique password (8 bytes).
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the ident. Each page is accessed sequentially. Writing to this file will change the password on the page. NOTE: Currently used password have to be set to correct password before changing password. Data in the corresponding page is NOT effected.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.SS address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceeding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS present
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
.SH ALARMS
