.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS channels
.I read-only, unsigned integer
.br
Is this a 1 or 2 channel switch? The
.I DS2406
comes in two forms, one has only one
.PIO
pin (PIO.A). Returns 1 or 2.
.SS memory
.I read-write, binary
.br
128 bytes of non-volatile, write-once data.
.SS pages/page.0 ... pages/page.3 pages/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory organized as 4 pages or 32 bytes. Memory is write-once.
.br
.I ALL
is the aggregate of all 4 pages, sequentially accessed.
.SS PIO.A PIO.B PIO.ALL
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
State of the open-drain output (
.I PIO
) pin. 0 = non-conducting (off), 1 = conducting (on).
.br
Writing zero will turn off the switch, non-zero will turn on the switch. Reading the
.I PIO
state will return the switch setting. To determine the actual logic level at the switch, refer to the
.I sensed
property.
.br
.I ALL
references both channels simultaneously, comma separated.
.SS power
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the
.I DS2406
powered parasitically (0) or separately on the Vcc pin (1)?
.SS sensed.A sensed.B sensed.ALL
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Logic level at the
.I PIO
pin. 0 = ground. 1 = high (~2.4V - 5V ). Really makes sense only if the
.I PIO
state is set to zero (off), else will read zero.
.br
.I ALL
references both channels simultaneously, comma separated.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.SS address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceeding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS present
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
.SH ALARMS
None implemented.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a 1-wire bus device. The 1-wire bus is a simple networking system created by Dalla Semiconductor that allows low-cost low-power communication over a single wire (plus ground). Power is often delivered "parasitically" from the same data line. Each device has a unique unalterable ID and can be individually addressed.
.PP
The
.B DS2406
allows control of other devices, like LEDs and relays. It superceeds the
.B DS2405
and
.B DS2407
Alternative switches include the
.B DS2408
or even
.B DS2450
.br
The
.B DS2407
is practically identical to the
.DS2406
except for a strange
.I hidden
mode. It is supported as a
.B DS2406
.SH ADDRESSING
All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:
.TP
.B Family Code
8 bits
.TP
.B Address
48 bits
.TP
.B CRC
8 bits
.IP
.PP
Addressing under OWFS is in hexidecimal, of form:
.IP
.B 01.123456789ABC
.PP
where
.B 01
is an example 8-bit family code, and
.B 12345678ABC
is an example 48 bit address.
.PP
The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
