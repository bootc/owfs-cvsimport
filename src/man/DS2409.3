.SH FAMILY CODE
.PP
.I 1F
.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS aux
.I directory
.br
This is the
.I aux
branch of the
.I DS2409
network branch. It is implicitly accessed (via the
.I aux smart-on
command) when it is listed or devices on this branch are addressed.
.SS branch.0 branch.1 branch.ALL branch.BYTE
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the branch (
.I 0=main
or
.I 1=aux
) currently connected to the master bus? Value returned is 1 (yes) or 0 (no). The
.I DS2409
should not allow both to be on simultaneously.
.br
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the properties, comma separated. It is an atomic operation.
.br
.I BYTE
is an aggregate of the branches as a byte, A is bit 0.
.SS control
.I read-write, unsigned integer
.br
Setting of the PIO
.I control
pin. There are 4 possible settings:
.TP
.B 0
Unconditionally off (non-conducting)
.TP
.B 1
Unconditionally on (conducting)
.TP
.B 2
Auto on when
.I main
branch switched in
.TP
.B 3
Auto on when
.I aux
branch switched in
.SS discharge
.I write-only, yes-no
.br
Writing a non-zero value to this property will electrically reset both the main and auxillary branches of the 1-wire bus by dropping power for 100 milliseconds. All devices on those branches will lose parasitic power and reset to power-up defaults. As a side effect, both
.I event
flags and thus, the alarm state, are cleared, too.
.SS event.0 event.1 event.ALL event.BYTE
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Has the
.I event
flag for the branch been triggered? A negative edge on the disconnected branch (
.I 0=main
or
.I 1=aux
) sets the flag. This is achieved by e.g. connecting an iButton to the branch. Value returned is 1 (yes) or 0 (no).
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the properties, comma separated. It is an atomic operation.
.br
.I BYTE
is an aggregate of the branches as a byte,
.I main
is bit 0.
.SS clearevent
.I write-only, yes-no
.br
Writing a non-zero value to this property will reset both
.I event
flags and thus, clear the alarm state, too.
.br
.SS main
.I directory
.br
This is the
.I main
branch of the
.I DS2409
network branch. It is implicitly accessed (via the
.I main smart-on
command) when it is listed or devices on this branch are addressed.
.SS sensed.0 sensed.1 sensed.ALL sensed.BYTE
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Voltage sensed at the
.I 0=main
or
.I 1=aux
branch pin. Valid only when the branch is switched out. Value returned is 0 (low) or 1 (high).
.br
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the properties, comma separated. It is an atomic operation.
.br
.I BYTE
is an aggregate of the branches as a byte, A is bit 0.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.so standard
.SH ALARMS
The
.I DS2409
will respond to a conditional search if the 
.I main
event flag is set.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.so description.3so
.SS DS2409
The
.B DS2409 (3)
allows complex 1-wire network topology. Each branch has it's power preserved, even when isolated from the master. A separate PIO pin can be configured to show branch switching, or controlled explicitly.
