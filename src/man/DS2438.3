.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS date
.I read-write, ascii
.br
26 character date representation of the
.I counter
value. Increments once per second.
.br
Setting
.I date
to a null string will put the current system time.
.br
Accepted date formats are:
.br
  Sat[urday] March 12 12:23:59 2001
.br
  Apr[il] 4 9:34:56 2002
.br
  3/23/04 23:34:57
.br
  current locale setting (your system's format)
.SS current
.I read-only, integer
.br
Current reading. Actual current depends on Rsens resistor (see datasheet).
.br
The formula for current is I =
.I current
/(4096*Rsens)
.br
with units in Amps and Ohms.
.br
Current measurement will be temporarily enabled (see
.I Ienable
) if not currently enabled (pun intended) for this reading.
.SS disconnect/date
.I read-write, ascii
.br
26 character date representation of the
.I disconnect/udate
value. Time when the battery pack waws removed from the charger. Format is the same as the 
.I date
property.
.SS disconnect/udate
.I read-write, unsigned integer
.br
Representation of
.I disconnect/date
as a number. See
.I udate
for details.
.SS endcharge/date
.I read-write, ascii
.br
26 character date representation of the
.I endcharge/udate
value. Format is the same as the 
.date
property.
.SS endcharge/udate
.I read-write, unsigned integer
.br
Representation of
.I endcharge/date
as a number. See
.I udate
for details.
.SS humidity
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Relative humidity, as percent (1-100 scale).
.br
The
.B DS2438
actually does not read humidity, but a widely available and publicised circuit based on the chip, does. See the datasheets for details.
.SS Ienable
.I read-write, unsigned integer
.br
Status of
.I current
monitoring. When enabled, current sensing is performed 36.41 times/second. Values of
.I Ienable
are:
.TP
.B 0
no current conversion
.TP
.B 1
current conversion enabled
.TP
.B 2
current conversion and accumulation
.TP
.B 3
current conversion and accumulation with EEPROM backup
.SS offset
.I read-write, integer
.br
Correction for
.I current
readings. A value between -256 and 255. See the datasheet for details. Should be set to the negative of a true zero
.I current
reading.
.SS pages/page.0 ... pages/page.7 pages/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 8 pages of 8 bytes each. Only the pages 3-7 are really available, and some of that appears to be reserved. See the datasheet for details.
.br
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially.
.SS temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
.I Temperature
read by the chip at high resolution (~13 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
Conversion takes ~20 msec.
.SS udate
.I read-write, unsigned integer
.br
Time represented as a number.
.I udate
increments once per second.
.br
Usually set to unix time standard: number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970. The
.I date
field will be the unix representation (ascii text) of
.I udate
and setting either will change the other.
.SS VAD VDD
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Voltage read (~10 bits) at the one of the chip's two supply voltages. Range VDD= 2.4V to 10V, VAD=1.5 to 10V.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.SS address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceeding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS present
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
.SH ALARMS
None.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.so description
.SS DS2438
The
.B DS2438 (3)
is a more complete form of the
.B DS2436
battery chip. Current sensing is availble, but not implemented. The major advantage compared to the
.B DS2436
is that two voltages can be read, allowing correcting circuit nmeasurements to supply voltage and temperature. A better comparison is the 
.B DS276x
family of chips.
