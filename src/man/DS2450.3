.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS memory
.I read-write, binary
.br
32 bytes of data. Much has special implications. See the datasheet.
.SS pages/page.0 ... pages/page.3 pages/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 4 pages of 8 bytes each. Mostly for reading and setting device properties. See the datasheet for details.
.br
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially.
.SS PIO.A ... PIO.D PIO.ALL
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
Pins used for digital control. 1 turns the switch on (conducting). 0 turns the switch off (non-conducting).
.br
Control is specifically enabled. Reading
.I volt
will turn off this control.
.br
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the voltages. Readings are made separately.
.SS power
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
Is the
.I DS2450
externally powered? (As opposed to parasitically powered from the data line).
.br
The analog A/D  will be kept on continuously. And the bus will be released during a conversion allowing other devices to communicate.
.br
Set true (1) only if Vcc powered (not parasitically powered). Unfortunately, the
.I DS2450
cannot sense it's powered state. This flag must be explicitly written, and thus is a potential source of error if incorrectly set.
.br
It is always safe to leave
.I power
set to the default 0 (off) state.
.SS volt.A ... volt.D volt.ALL
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Voltage read, 16 bit resolution. Range 0 - 5.10V.
.br
Output (
.I PIO
) is specifically disabled.
.br
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the voltages. Readings are made separately.
.SS volt2.A ... volt2.D volt2.ALL
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Voltage read, 16 bit resolution. Range 0 - 2.55V.
.br
Output (
.I PIO
) is specifically disabled.
.br
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the voltages. Readings are made separately.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.so description
.SS DS2450
The
.B DS2450 (3)
is a (supposedly) high resolution A/D converter with 4 channels. Actual resolutin is reporterd to be 8 bits. The channels can also function as switches. Voltage sensing (with temperature and current, but sometimes restricted voltrage ranges) can also be obtained with the
.B DS2436
,
.B DS2438
and
.B DS276x
