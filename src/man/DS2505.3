.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS memory
.I read-write, binary
.br
2048 bytes of memory. Initially all bits are set to 1. Writing zero permanently alters the memory.
.SS page.0 ... page.63 page.ALL
.I read-write, yes-no
.br
Memory is split into 64 pages of 32 bytes each.
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.SS address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceeding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS present
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
.SH ALARMS
None.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a 1-wire bus device. The 1-wire bus is a simple networking system created by Dalla Semiconductor that allows low-cost low-power communication over a single wire (plus ground). Power is often delivered "parasitically" from the same data line. Each device has a unique unalterable ID and can be individually addressed.
.PP
The
.B DS2505
is used for write-once incremental storage. It's main advantage is for audit trails (i.e. a digital purse).
.PP
The
.B DS2505-UNW
is one of the
.I UniqueWare
class of devices. Some of the memory was preprogramed at the factory. See the datasheet for specifics. The
.B DS2502
,
.B DS2505
, and
.B DS2506
differ in their function by the amount of on-board memory they possess. (The internal protocols are slightly different, but the
.I OWFS
system handles this automatically.
.SH ADDRESSING
All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:
.TP
.B Family Code
8 bits
.TP
.B Address
48 bits
.TP
.B CRC
8 bits
.IP
.PP
Addressing under OWFS is in hexidecimal, of form:
.IP
.B 01.123456789ABC
.PP
where
.B 01
is an example 8-bit family code, and
.B 12345678ABC
is an example 48 bit address.
.PP
The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
