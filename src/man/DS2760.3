.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS accumulator
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Accumulated amperage read by current sensor. Units are in
.B Amp-hr
(Assumes internal resistor).
.SS current
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Current reading. Units are in
.B Amp
(Assumes internal resistor).
.SS offset
.I read-write, floating point
.br
Correction for
.I current
readings. Units are in
.B Amp
and can range from -.08 to +.08
.SS ext_sense
.I read-only, floating point
.br
External resistor current sensor reading. Units are in
.B Volts
(Assumes external resistor).
.SS offset
.I read-write, floating point
.br
Correction for
.I current
readings. Units are in
.B Amp
and can range from -.08 to +.08
.SS pages/page.0 ... pages/page.16 pages/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 16 pages of 16 bytes each. Only some of that is available. See the datasheet for details.
.br
Some portions of memory are EEPROM backed. Recall from, and writing to EEPROM will be done transparently.
.br
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially.
.SS PIO
.I write-only, yes-no
.br
Controls the PIO pin allowing external switching.
.br
Writing "1" turns the PIO pin on (conducting). Writing "0" makes the pin non-conducting.
The logical state of the voltage can be read with the
.I sensed
property. This will reflect the current voltage at the pin, not the value sent to
.I PIO
.br
Note also that
.I PIO
will also be altered by the power-status of the
.I DS2670
See the datasheet for details.
.SS sensed
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
The logical voltage at the PIO pin. Useful only if the
.I PIO
property is set to "0" (non-conducting).
.br
Value will be 0 or 1 depending on the voltage threshold.
.SS typeX/
.I directory
.br
Thermocouple circuit using the
.I  DS2760
to read the Seebeck voltage and the reference temperature. Since the type interpretation of the values read depends on the type of thermocouple, the correct directory must be chosen. Supported thermocouple types include types B, E, J, K, N, R, S and T.
.SS typeX/range_low typeX/ranges_high
.I read-only, flaoting point
.br
The lower and upper temperature supported by this thermocouple (at least by the conversion routines). In the globally chosen temperature units.
.SS typeX/temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Thermocouple temperature. Requires a voltage and temperature conversion. Returned in globally chosen temperature units.
.br
Note: there are two types of temperature measurements possible. The
.I temperature
value in the main device directory is the reference temperature read at the chip. The
.I typeX/temperature
value is at the thermocouple junction, probably remote from the chip.
.SS temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
.I Temperature
read by the chip at high resolution (~13 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
.br
Conversion is continuous.
.SS volt
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Voltage read between pins Vin and Vss. Units are in
.B Volt
.br
Range is between 0 and 4.75V
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES

.SH ALARMS
None.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.so description
.SS DS2760 DS2761 DS2762
The
.B DS2760 (3)
is a class of battery charging controllers. There are minor hardware difference between the
.B DS2760, DS2761
and
.B DS2762
battery chip, but they are indistiguishable to the software.
.PP
A number of interesting devices can be built with the
.B DS276x 
including thermocouples. Support for thermocouples in built into the software, using the embedded thermister as the cold junction temperature.
.PP
For an explanatino of the differences between the 
.B DS276x
variants, see Dallas Application Note 221.
