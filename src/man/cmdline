.SH STANDARD OPTIONS
.SS -c file | --configuration file
Name of a
.B owfs (5)
configuration file with more command line parameters
.SS \-C \-\-Celsius | \-F \-\-Fahrenheit | \-K \-\-Kelvin | \-R \-\-Rankine
Temperature scale used for data output. Celsius is the default.
.SS \-r \-\-readonly
.SS \-w \-\-write
Do we allow writing to the 1-wire bus (writing memory, setting switches, limits, PIOs)? The
.I write
option is available for symmetry, it's the default.
.SS \-d \-\-device "deviceport"
Sets the serial port. It should have a LINK, DS9097U or DS9097 (passive adapter) attached. The "-d" is implied if two arguments are supplied. (See examples). Also accepted is i2c devices (e.g. /dev/i2c-0)
.br
Note: multiple instances of
.I -d, -u, -s
are allowed. Each corresponds to a different 1-wire bus. The result will reflect the logical union of those buses.
.SS \-s [host:]port
Connect via tcp (network) to an
.I owserver
process that is connected to a physical 1-wire bus. This allows multiple processes to share the same bus. The
.I owserver
process can be local, or remote.
.br
Note: multiple instances of
.I -d, -u, -s
are allowed. Each corresponds to a different 1-wire bus. The result will reflect the logical union of those buses.
.SS \-u \-\-usb
Use the USB adapter (DS9490) as 1-wire bus master. An optional number 1,2,... specifies which adapter to use if more than one is present.
.br
Use
.I all
instead of a number (e.g. \-uall) to discover and use all DS9490 USB adapters.
Note: multiple instances of
.I -d, -u, -s
are allowed. Each corresponds to a different 1-wire bus. The result will reflect the logical union of those buses.
.SH HELP OPTIONS
.SS \-h \-\-help
Shows basic summary of options.
.SS \-\-morehelp
Show less common options.
.SS \-V \-\-version
.I Version
of this program and related libraries.
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.SS \-\-background | \-\-foreground
Whether the program releases the console and runs in the
\.I background
after evaluating command line options.
.I background
is the default.
.SS \-\-link | \-\-nolink
All serial adapters manufactured by iButtonLink should be used in their ascii mode rather than the (default)DS9097U emulation. This allows some extended features, but interfears with DS2409 (3) hubs. 
.SS \-\-error_print
.TP
.I 0
default mixed destination: stderr foreground / syslog background
.TP
.I 1
syslog only
.TP
.I 2
stderr only
.TP
.I 3
dev/null (supress all).
.SS \-\-error_level
.TP
.I 0
default errors only
.TP
.I 1
connections/disconnections
.TP
.I 2
all high level calls
.TP
.I 3
data summary for each call
.TP
.I 4
details level
.TP
.I >4
debugging chaff
.SS \-f \-\-format "f[.]i[[.]c]"
Display format for the 1-wire devices. Each device has a 8byte address, consisting of:
.TP
.I f
family code, 1 byte
.TP
.I i
ID number, 6 bytes
.TP
.I c
CRC checksum, 1 byte
.PP
Possible formats are
.I f.i
(default, 01.A1B2C3D4E5F6),
.I fi fic f.ic f.i.c
and
.I fi.c
.PP
All formats are accepted as input, but the output will be in the specified format.
.SS \-P \-\-pid-file "filename"
Places the PID -- process ID of owfs into the specified filename. Useful for startup scripts control.
.SS \-t \-\-timeout "seconds"
Set the number of seconds that volitile data (measured values like temperature and voltage) should be cached before requerying the BUS. More stable values will be saved ten times longer (switch settings, memory contents). 10 seconds is the default.
.SS msec_read
Milliseconds before read timeout (for serial reads). Some embedded systems, and USB->serial adapters seem to need more than the default 500 msec.
