.SH STANDARD OPTIONS
.SS -c file | --configuration file
Name of a
.B owfs (5)
configuration file with more command line parameters
.SS \-r \-\-readonly
.SS \-w \-\-write
Do we allow writing to the 1-wire bus (writing memory, setting switches, limits, PIOs)? The
.I write
option is available for symmetry, it's the default.
.SS \-d \-\-device "deviceport"
Sets the serial port. It should have a LINK, DS9097U or DS9097 (passive adapter) attached. The "-d" is implied if two arguments are supplied. (See examples). Also accepted is i2c devices (e.g. /dev/i2c-0)
.br
Note: multiple instances of
.I -d, -u, -s
are allowed. Each corresponds to a different 1-wire bus. The result will reflect the logical union of those buses.
.SS \-s [host:]port
Connect via tcp (network) to an
.I owserver
process that is connected to a physical 1-wire bus. This allows multiple processes to share the same bus. The
.I owserver
process can be local, or remote.
.br
Note: multiple instances of
.I -d, -u, -s
are allowed. Each corresponds to a different 1-wire bus. The result will reflect the logical union of those buses.
.SS \-u \-\-usb
Use the USB adapter (DS9490) as 1-wire bus master. An optional number 1,2,... specifies which adapter to use if more than one is present.
.br
Use
.I all
instead of a number (e.g. \-uall) to discover and use all DS9490 USB adapters.
Note: multiple instances of
.I -d, -u, -s
are allowed. Each corresponds to a different 1-wire bus. The result will reflect the logical union of those buses.
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.SS \-\-background | \-\-foreground
Whether the program releases the console and runs in the
\.I background
after evaluating command line options.
.I background
is the default.
.SS \-\-link | \-\-nolink
All serial adapters manufactured by iButtonLink should be used in their ascii mode rather than the (default)DS9097U emulation. This allows some extended features, but interfears with DS2409 (3) hubs. 
.SS \-\-error_print
.TP
.I 0
default mixed destination: stderr foreground / syslog background
.TP
.I 1
syslog only
.TP
.I 2
stderr only
.TP
.I 3
dev/null (supress all).
.SS \-\-error_level
.TP
.I 0
default errors only
.TP
.I 1
connections/disconnections
.TP
.I 2
all high level calls
.TP
.I 3
data summary for each call
.TP
.I 4
details level
.TP
.I >4
debugging chaff
.SS \-P \-\-pid-file "filename"
Places the PID -- process ID of owfs into the specified filename. Useful for startup scripts control.
