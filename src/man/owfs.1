.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B owfs
is a user-space (virtual) filesystem that shows the Dallas/Maxim 1-Wire bus with all the 1-wire devices that are attached. Devices are main directory entries, and each device is in turn a directory of its properties (like ID, memory, temperature, voltage). These files are generated on the fly whenever a 1-wire device is accessed. 1-wire devices are uniquely labeled at the factory. This unique ID is the directory name for that device. The files for each device vary with the type of device. The names are pretty self-explanatory, and there is extensive documentation.
.PP
1-wire is a protocol developed by Dallas/Maxim to allow communication and power over the same electrical line. Each device can be discovered, and addressed. The system expects intermittent connections, and is well suited to control and monitoring applications. The protocol is a bit-level protocol that clearly has evolved over time.
.I owfs
hides the details of the low-level 1-wire protocol with a file-system metaphor.
.PP
To speed data access,
.I owfs
can cache recently accessed data, and device listings. 
There is optional data caching. Which can speed repeated access to the same 1-wire properties (but is potentially confusing). Use the uncached directory to see immediate values.
.TP
The underlying interface to the 1-wire bus is identical to OWHTTPD -- the 1-wire web server. Only the top layer has been modified to serve files instead of web pages. Development here, and support for new devices, will progress with that project.
.TP
The 1-wire file system is a modified version of fuse examples by Miklos Szeredi. Th, and serves no files. Security should therefore be good. Only the 1-wire bus is at risk. The fuse library and kernel module is needed. (See http://fuse.sourceforge.net)

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-h \-\-help
Shows this summary of options.
.SS \-d \-\-device "deviceport"
Sets the serial port. It should have a LINK, DS9097U or DS9097 (passive adapter) attached. The "-d" is implied if two arguments are supplied. (See examples). The
.I \-d
and
.I \-u
options are mutually exclusive.
.SS \-u \-\-usb
Use the USB adapter (DS9490) as 1-wire bus master. An optional number 1,2,... specifies which adapter to use if more than one is present.
.SS \-t \-\-timeout "seconds"
Set the number of seconds that volitile data (measured values like temperature and voltage) should be cached before requerying the BUS. More stable values will be saved ten times longer (switch settings, memory contents). 10 seconds is the default.
.SS \-C \-\-Celsius | \-F \-\-Fahrenheit | \-K \-\-Kelvin | \-R \-\-Rankine
Temperature scale used for data output. Celsius is the default.
.SS \-f \-\-format "f[.]i[[.]c]"
Display format for the 1-wire devices. Each device has a 8byte address, consisting of 1byte
.I f
amily code, 6 byte
.I I
D number, and 1 byte
.I C
RC checksum.
.PP
Possible formats are
.I f.i
(default, 01.A1B2C3D4E5F6),
.I fi fic f.ic f.i.c
and
.I fi.c
.PP
All formats are accepted as input, but the output will be in the specified format.
.SS \-\-background | \-\-foreground
Whether the program releases the console and runs in the
\.I background
after evaluating command line options.
.I background
is the default.
.SS \-V \-\-version
.I Version
of this program and related libraries.
.SS \-P \-\-pid-file "filename"
Places the PID -- process ID of owfs into the specified filename. Useful for startup scripts control.
.SS \-\-fuse-opt "options"
Sends options to the fuse-mount process. Options should be quoted, e.g. "-x" (which allows others to mount this directory).
.SH EXAMPLE
owfs -d /dev/ttyS0 /mnt/1wire
.TP
owfs /dev/ttyS0 /mnt/1wire
