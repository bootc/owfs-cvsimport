.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B owhttpd
is a small webserver that shows the Dallas/Maxim 1-Wire bus attached to a serial port. The main view shows the devices found, You can then navigate to individual devices, and view/alter their properties.
.TP
There is optional data caching. Which can speed repeated access to the same 1wire properties (but is potentially confusing). Use the uncached links to see immediate values.
.TP
The underlying interface to the 1-wire bus is identical to OWFS -- the 1-wire filesystem for linux. Only the top layer has been modified to serve web pages instead of files. Development here, and support for new devices, will progress with that project.
.TP
The web server is a modified version of chttpd by Greg Olszewski. It is now single-threaded, and serves no files. Security should therefore be good. Only the 1-wire bus is at risk.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-p portnum
Sets the tcp port the web server runs on. Access with the URL http://servernameoripaddress:portnum
.SS \-h \-\-help
Shows this summary of options.
.SS \-d \-\-device "deviceport"
Sets the serial port. It should have a LINK, DS9097U or DS9097 (passive adapter) attached. The "-d" is implied if two arguments are supplied. (See examples). The
.I \-d
and
.I \-u
options are mutually exclusive.
.SS \-u \-\-usb
Use the USB adapter (DS9490) as 1-wire bus master. An optional number 1,2,... specifies which adapter to use if more than one is present.
.SS \-t \-\-timeout "seconds"
Set the number of seconds that volitile data (measured values like temperature and voltage) should be cached before requerying the BUS. More stable values will be saved ten times longer (switch settings, memory contents). 10 seconds is the default.
.SS \-C \-\-Celsius | \-F \-\-Fahrenheit | \-K \-\-Kelvin | \-R \-\-Rankine
Temperature scale used for data output. Celsius is the default.
.SS \-f \-\-format "f[.]i[[.]c]"
Display format for the 1-wire devices. Each device has a 8byte address, consisting of 1byte
.I f
amily code, 6 byte
.I I
D number, and 1 byte
.I C
RC checksum.
.PP
Possible formats are
.I f.i
(default, 01.A1B2C3D4E5F6),
.I fi fic f.ic f.i.c
and
.I fi.c
.PP
All formats are accepted as input, but the output will be in the specified format.
.SS \-\-background | \-\-foreground
Whether the program releases the console and runs in the
\.I background
after evaluating command line options.
.I background
is the default.
.SS \-V \-\-version
.I Version
of this program and related libraries.
.SH EXAMPLE
owhttpd -p 3001 -d /dev/ttyS0
