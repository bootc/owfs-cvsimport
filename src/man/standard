.SS address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceeding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexidecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS present
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Is the device currently
.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS r_address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
.I address
in reverse order, which is often used in other applications and labeling.
.I crc8
comes first and
.I family
last.
.br
Note, this means that each hex byte (2 characters) is reversed, not the text string.
.SS r_id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
.I id
in reverse order, which is often used in other applications and labeling.
.br
Note, this means that each hex byte (2 characters) is reversed, not the text string.
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Part name assigned by Dallas Semi. E.g.
.I DS2401
Alternative packaging (iButton vs chip) will not be distiguished.
