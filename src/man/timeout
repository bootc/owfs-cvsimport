.SH TIME OPTIONS
These options affect the times that data stays in memory, and the times that the program will wait for network or external device responses. Default values are shown.
.SS --timeout_volatile=15
Seconds until a 
.I volatile 
property expires in the cache. Volatile properties are those (like temperature) that change on their own.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/volatile
.SS --timeout_stable=300
Seconds until a 
.I stable 
property expires in the cache. Stable properties are those that shouldn't change unless explicitly changed. Memory contents for example.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/stable
.SS --timeout_directory=60
Seconds until a 
.I directory 
listing expires in the cache. Directory lists are the 1-wire devices found on the bus.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/directory
.SS --timeout_presence=120
Seconds until the
.I presence
and bus location of a 1-wire device expires in the cache.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/presence
.SS --timeout_serial=5
Seconds until the expected response from the
.I serial
port adapter is deemed tardy. Applies to the LINK, DS9097U and DS9097 (passive) adapter.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/serial
.SS --timeout_usb=5
Seconds until the expected response from the
.I usb
port adapter is deemed tardy. Applies to the DS9490.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/network
.SS --timeout_network=1
Seconds until the expected response from the
.I tcp
port adapter is deemed tardy. Includes the
.B LINK-HUB-E
and
.B HA7Net
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/network
.SS --timeout_server=5
Seconds until the expected response from the
.B owserver (1)
is deemed tardy.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/server
.SS --timeout_ftp=900
Seconds that an ftp session is kept alive.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/ftp
.SS --timeout_ha7=60
Seconds that the program will wait for a (tcp) response from the HA7Net adapter.
.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/ha7
