.SH TIME OPTIONS
These options affect the times that data stays in memory, and the times that the program will wait for network or external device responses. Default values are shown.
.SS --timeout_volatile=15
Seconds until a

.I /settings/timeout/volatile
.SS --timeout_stable=300
Seconds until a 
.I stable

.PP
Can be changed within the program at 
.I /settings/timeout/stable
.SS --timeout_directory=60
Seconds until a 
.I directory 
listing expires in the cache. Directory lists are the 1-wire devices found on the bus.

Seconds until the expected response from the
.I serial
port adapter is deemed tardy. Applies to the LINK, DS9097U and DS9097 (passive) adapter.
.PP
