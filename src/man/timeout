.SS --timeout_usb=5
Seconds until the expected response from the

.SS --timeout_network=5

.SS --timeout_ftp
.SS --timeout_httpd
.SS --timeout_persistent_low

.B owserver (1)
is kept open. This is the limit used when the number of connections is above
.I --clients_persistent_low
.SS --timeout_persistent_high
Maximum seconds that a persistent tcp connection to
.B owserver (1)
is kept open. This is the limit used when the number of connections is below
.I --clients_persistent_low
.SS --clients_persistent_low
Maximum number of persistent tcp connections to
.B owserver (1)
before connections start getting the more stringent time limitation
.I --timeout_persistent_low
.SS --clients_persistent_high
Maximum number of persistent tcp connections to before no more are allowed (only non-persistent at this point).
.B owserver (1)
